source/conf.py: This is the file where all Sphinx configuration settings (including the settings we specified during the sphinx-quickstart setup) are specified. When any make <builder> or sphinx-build <builder> command is called, Sphinx runs this file to extract the desired configuration.

source/index.rst: This is the file which tells Sphinx how to render our index.html page. In general, each source/*.rst file is converted to a corresponding build/html/*.html page when make html is called.

To update automatic python package usage docs (swspy.rst etc):
sphinx-apidoc -f -o source ../swspy

To compile docs:
make clean 
make html

Or can run this to build:
To update automatic python package usage docs (swspy.rst etc):
sphinx-apidoc -f -o source ../swspy
