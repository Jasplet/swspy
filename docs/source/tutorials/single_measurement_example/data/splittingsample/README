Sample data for splitting package

Waveform data can be found in the data directory, with each component stored as a SAC file
Splitting results, as measured by SHEBA, can be found in Sample_SKS_SKKS_data.sdb

Column headers are as follows:
 - STAT : Station Code
 - DATE : Event data in format yyyjjj
 - TIME : Event time in format hhmmss
 - PHASE : Shear-wave phase measured
 - EVLA : Event Latitude
 - EVLO : Event Longitude
 - EVDP : Event depth (km)
 - STLA : Station Latitude
 - STLO : Station Longitude
 - GCARC : Station to event great circle arc length (degrees)
 - BAZ : Station to event azimuth (i.e. backazimuth)
 - AZI : Event to station azimuth
 - WBEG : Analysis window start time (seconds)
 - WEND : Analysis window end time (seconds)
 - LOWMM_LAT : Up-going core-mantle pierce (or bounce) point latitude 
 - LOWMM_LON : Up-going core-mantle pierce (or bounce) point longitude
 - FAST : Fast direction (degrees)
 - DFAST : Fast direction unceretainty (degrees)
 - TLAG : Delay time (seconds)
 - DTLAG : Delay time uncertainty (seconds)
 - Q : Measurement Quality factor of Wuestefeld et al., (2010)
 - SNR : Signal-to-noise ratio. Estimated using method of Restive & Helffrich (1999)
 - NDF : Degrees of freedom
 - EIGORIG : Corrected eigenvalue ratio (lam2/lam2)
